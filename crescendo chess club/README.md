# Crescendo Halloween Chess Night

This repo contains a single-page interactive Halloween-themed chess demo for Crescendo Chess Club.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — game logic (puzzles, interactivity, audio, canvas bats)

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (owner: `bee-angyi`, name: `crescendo-halloween-chess-night`).
2. Upload the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to the repository (use GitHub web upload or push via git).
3. In the repository settings → Pages → Source → choose `main` (or `master`) branch / `/ (root)` and Save.
4. After a few minutes, your site will be available at: `https://bee-angyi.github.io/crescendo-halloween-chess-night/`
5. Use that URL to generate a QR code (e.g. https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=200x200&data=YOUR_URL)

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge). If audio doesn't autoplay, toggle the Music button.

## Note
- Puzzles are lightweight pre-defined patterns for live interaction; if you want full chess engine features (AI, move legality enforcement by engine, multi-player online), we can upgrade later.
